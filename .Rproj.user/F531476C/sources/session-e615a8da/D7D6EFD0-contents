# Example QMD File

This is a simple Quarto Markdown file for Assignment 2.

```{r gratitude_chunk}
print("Thank you for being an awesome Professor!")
```

```{r fix_conflict_S6}
##Resolving the conflict with a new chunk
print("Thank you for your time and patience")

```

The above section was added manually to resolve the merge conflict between main and testbranch and combine ideas from both branches.

```{r load_dataset_a2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Load the dataset
df_a2 <- read_csv("data/mental_health_prevalence_GBD2021.csv")
```

```{r overview_df_a2}
glimpse(df_a2)
```

## Global Trends in Depressive Disorders

As depicted in @prevalence-global-depression-plot, the global prevalence of depressive disorders remained fairly stable from 1990 to 2018 and a noticeable increase during the COVID-19 pandemic years.

```{r plot_S10}
#| label: prevalence-global-depression-plot
#| fig-cap: "Global prevalence of depressive disorders from 1990 to 2021 with uncertainity bounds represented using the shaded area"
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(ggplot2)

df_a2 %>%
  filter(location_name == "Global",
         cause_name == "Depressive disorders",
         metric_name == "Percent") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = val * 100)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower * 100, ymax = upper * 100), fill = "lightgray", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 0.8) +
  labs(
    title = "Global Prevalence of Depressive Disorders (1990â€“2021)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Prevalence (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13)
```
