# Introduction

This report demonstrates the utilization of Git and Quarto for collaborative and reproducible workflows in R. The following demonstrates a step-by-step walk through for completing the tasks required for Assignment 2 in the ETC5513 course. It covers setting up a Git repository, managing branches, resolving conflicts, and more, using the command line interface.

## 1. Create a New RStudio Project

-   Open RStudio and create a new RStudio project Select File → New Project → New Directory → New Project

-   Name the project (e.x - "ETC5513_Assignment_2") and choose a location.

-   Next create a ‘.qmd’ file by selecting File → New File → Quarto Document

-   Add some simple markdown content to ‘example.qmd’

-   Knit the file to HTML by Rendering it

A successful render should provide you with a HTML output with the same contents of your Quarto document

## 2. Initialize a Git repository and push to GitHub

-   Initialize the project folder ETC5513_Assignment_2 as a Git repository using `git init`

-   Create a new GitHub repository with the same name and connect the local repository to the remote GitHub repository using

    `git remote add origin https://github.com/rrad0002/ETC5513_Assignment_2.git`

-   Add and commit your initial files using the commands:

    `git add .`

    `git commit -m "Initial commit with example.qmd"`

-   Push the initial commit to the `main` branch

    `git branch -M main`

    `git push -u origin main`

## 5. Let's create a merge conflict and resolve it
